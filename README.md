# Privacy Preserving Outlier Detection (PPOD)

This repository contains assignments and solutions for **Privacy Preserving Outlier Detection (PPOD)**, focusing on methods to detect anomalies in datasets **while ensuring data privacy**.

## 🔍 Overview

Outlier detection, also called anomaly detection, identifies **data points that significantly deviate** from normal patterns. In privacy-sensitive environments, it is crucial to develop **secure, privacy-preserving methods** for anomaly detection. This repository explores techniques that achieve this goal.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each assignment is stored in a **separate folder**:

- **#1 Assignment/** – Initial exploration of outlier detection  
- **#2-3 Assignment/** – Advanced methods and implementation  
- **#4-5 Assignment/** – Collaborative research on PPOD  

Each folder contains:
- **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)** – Full solutions with code & explanations.
- **`requirements.txt`** – Lists required Python libraries.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   `git clone https://github.com/juliuspor/PPOD.git`

2. **Navigate to an Assignment Folder**  
   Open the assignment folder containing the required `.ipynb` notebook.

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)  
   - Create a virtual environment  
     `python3 -m venv env`  
   - Activate it:  
     - On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`  
     - On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`

4. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   Open a terminal in the assignment folder and run:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**  
   `jupyter notebook`  
   Then open the `.ipynb` file for the selected assignment.
