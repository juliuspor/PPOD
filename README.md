# Privacy Preserving Outlier Detection (PPOD)

This repository contains assignments and solutions for **Privacy Preserving Outlier Detection (PPOD)**, focusing on methods to detect anomalies in datasets **while ensuring data privacy**.

## Overview

Outlier detection, also called anomaly detection, identifies **data points that significantly deviate** from normal patterns. In privacy-sensitive environments, it is crucial to develop **secure, privacy-preserving methods** for anomaly detection. This repository explores techniques that achieve this goal.

## Repository Structure

Each assignment is stored in a **separate folder**:

- **#1 Assignment/** – Initial exploration of outlier detection  
- **#2-3 Assignment/** – Advanced methods and implementation  
- **#4-5 Assignment/** – Collaborative research on PPOD  

Each folder contains:
- **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)** – Full solutions with code & explanations.
- **`requirements.txt`** – Lists required Python libraries.
